# OpenCore0.6.2_for_HP_ELITEBOOK9480m
# This EFI also works on Big Sur!(11.1)(Although feels a little slow compared to 10.15.7)
My EFI for OpenCore 0.6.2 EFI folder for MacOS 10.15.7 for my HP Elitebook 9480m incase an update messes it up one day or if anybody else ever needs this.
Works with OC 0.6.6(Updated myself OC 0.6.2 to OC 0.6.6) as well (as long hange the files from OpenCorepkg and make the relevant changes to your config.plist!!)
